        DAY FOR PARTICULATES FROM 400 PM SATURDAY UNTIL 400 PM\nSUNDAY...\nThe Colorado
        Department of Public Health and Environment has\nissued the following...\nWHAT...Action
        Day for Particulates.\nWHERE...Douglas, Jefferson, Denver, western Arapahoe,
        western\nAdams, Broomfield, Boulder, Larimer, and Weld Counties\nWHEN...400
        PM Saturday October 03 to 400 PM Sunday October 04\nIMPACTS...Action Day for
        Particulates is now in effect for the\nseven-county Denver-Boulder metropolitan
        area. Requests to limit\ndriving of non- ZEV vehicles (i.e., gas or diesel)
        are now in\neffect until at least 4 PM Sunday, October 4, 2020.  Although
        air\nquality conditions have generally improved across much of the\nFront
        Range region on Saturday, fire activity is increasing at\nboth the Cameron
        Peak and Mullen wildfires. This may result in\nincreasing fine particulate
        concentrations across the region again\nlate Saturday afternoon through Sunday
        morning, especially for\nlocations near the fire in central and western Larimer
        County,\nalong with the I-25 corridor from Ft. Collins southward to Denver\nand
        perhaps Colorado Springs. CDPHE requests that activities, such\nas driving
        non-ZEV vehicles (i.e., gas or diesel), be reduced to\nlessen the impacts
        on air quality. Additional air pollution in\nthis region may directly worsen
        air quality or contribute to\nprecursors which may also adversely affect air
        quality.  For\nColorado air quality conditions, forecasts and advisories,
        visit:\nhttps://www.colorado.gov/airquality/colorado_summary.aspx\nHEALTH
        INFORMATION...If smoke is thick or becomes thick in your\nneighborhood you
        may want to remain indoors. This is especially\ntrue for those with heart
        disease, respiratory illnesses, the very\nyoung, and the elderly. Consider
        limiting outdoor activity when\nmoderate to heavy smoke is present. Consider
        relocating\ntemporarily if smoke is present indoors and is making you ill.
        If\nvisibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in your neighborhood,\nsmoke
        has reached levels that are unhealthy."}]}'

        DAY FOR PARTICULATES FROM 400 PM SATURDAY UNTIL 400 PM\nSUNDAY...\nThe Colorado
        Department of Public Health and Environment has\nissued the following...\nWHAT...Action
        Day for Particulates.\nWHERE...Douglas, Jefferson, Denver, western Arapahoe,
        western\nAdams, Broomfield, Boulder, Larimer, and Weld Counties\nWHEN...400
        PM Saturday October 03 to 400 PM Sunday October 04\nIMPACTS...Action Day for
        Particulates is now in effect for the\nseven-county Denver-Boulder metropolitan
        area. Requests to limit\ndriving of non- ZEV vehicles (i.e., gas or diesel)
        are now in\neffect until at least 4 PM Sunday, October 4, 2020.  Although
        air\nquality conditions have generally improved across much of the\nFront
        Range region on Saturday, fire activity is increasing at\nboth the Cameron
        Peak and Mullen wildfires. This may result in\nincreasing fine particulate
        concentrations across the region again\nlate Saturday afternoon through Sunday
        morning, especially for\nlocations near the fire in central and western Larimer
        County,\nalong with the I-25 corridor from Ft. Collins southward to Denver\nand
        perhaps Colorado Springs. CDPHE requests that activities, such\nas driving
        non-ZEV vehicles (i.e., gas or diesel), be reduced to\nlessen the impacts
        on air quality. Additional air pollution in\nthis region may directly worsen
        air quality or contribute to\nprecursors which may also adversely affect air
        quality.  For\nColorado air quality conditions, forecasts and advisories,
        visit:\nhttps://www.colorado.gov/airquality/colorado_summary.aspx\nHEALTH
        INFORMATION...If smoke is thick or becomes thick in your\nneighborhood you
        may want to remain indoors. This is especially\ntrue for those with heart
        disease, respiratory illnesses, the very\nyoung, and the elderly. Consider
        limiting outdoor activity when\nmoderate to heavy smoke is present. Consider
        relocating\ntemporarily if smoke is present indoors and is making you ill.
        If\nvisibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in your neighborhood,\nsmoke
        has reached levels that are unhealthy."}]}'

        DAY FOR PARTICULATES FROM 400 PM SATURDAY UNTIL 400 PM\nSUNDAY...\nThe Colorado
        Department of Public Health and Environment has\nissued the following...\nWHAT...Action
        Day for Particulates.\nWHERE...Douglas, Jefferson, Denver, western Arapahoe,
        western\nAdams, Broomfield, Boulder, Larimer, and Weld Counties\nWHEN...400
        PM Saturday October 03 to 400 PM Sunday October 04\nIMPACTS...Action Day for
        Particulates is now in effect for the\nseven-county Denver-Boulder metropolitan
        area. Requests to limit\ndriving of non- ZEV vehicles (i.e., gas or diesel)
        are now in\neffect until at least 4 PM Sunday, October 4, 2020.  Although
        air\nquality conditions have generally improved across much of the\nFront
        Range region on Saturday, fire activity is increasing at\nboth the Cameron
        Peak and Mullen wildfires. This may result in\nincreasing fine particulate
        concentrations across the region again\nlate Saturday afternoon through Sunday
        morning, especially for\nlocations near the fire in central and western Larimer
        County,\nalong with the I-25 corridor from Ft. Collins southward to Denver\nand
        perhaps Colorado Springs. CDPHE requests that activities, such\nas driving
        non-ZEV vehicles (i.e., gas or diesel), be reduced to\nlessen the impacts
        on air quality. Additional air pollution in\nthis region may directly worsen
        air quality or contribute to\nprecursors which may also adversely affect air
        quality.  For\nColorado air quality conditions, forecasts and advisories,

        INFORMATION...If smoke is thick or becomes thick in your\nneighborhood you
        may want to remain indoors. This is especially\ntrue for those with heart
        disease, respiratory illnesses, the very\nyoung, and the elderly. Consider
        limiting outdoor activity when\nmoderate to heavy smoke is present. Consider
        relocating\ntemporarily if smoke is present indoors and is making you ill.
        If\nvisibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in your neighborhood,\nsmoke
        has reached levels that are unhealthy."}]}'
